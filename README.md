# Blob-Blob
Blob-Blob (the best name I could think of in 5min) is my first attempt at a Godot 2D Platformer.

# Scope of the Game
Blob-Blob will not be overly complex and will have the bog-standard elements of a platformer with additional features I see fit as I develop it.

The currently planned MVP features include:
- [x] Visual Art + Animations
  - [x] Sprites for player in various states
  - [x] Basic tiles and platforms
  - [x] Enemy sprites
  - [x] A logo (plus other menu related items)
- [x] Basic 2D Movement
  - [x] Walking (or sliding) left and right
  - [x] Jumping
- [x] Interactions with Game Environment
  - [x] One-way platforms
  - [x] A means of attack
- [ ] Enemies
  - [x] Basic Movement
  - [ ] AI to follow player
  - [x] Drop item(s) on death
- [ ] At least 3-5 different stages/levels
